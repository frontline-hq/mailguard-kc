# Why DMARC?

## Preventing Unauthorized Use of Your Domain

When DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) is properly configured, it ensures that only authorized senders can send emails from your domain. This drastically reduces the chances of attackers spoofing your domain name to send fraudulent emails, such as phishing attempts, impersonations, or other malicious activitie

Email continues to be a major vector for cyberattacks, with over [**90% of network breaches**](https://spanning.com/resources/reports/tech-trends-and-insights-survey-backup-report/) originating from phishing and email spoofing. DMARC helps domain owners protect their email infrastructure from such threats.

## Key Reasons to Implement DMARC

### 1. **Preventing Phishing and Spoofing attacks from your domain**

Phishing attacks impersonate trusted brands or individuals to trick recipients into disclosing sensitive information. Spoofing is a similar technique where attackers forge the `"From"` address of an email to make it appear as though it’s coming from a legitimate source. **DMARC** prevents unauthorized use of your domain by verifying that emails originate from approved servers and have not been tampered with.

### 2. **Reducing Business Email Compromise (BEC)**

Business Email Compromise (BEC) is a type of phishing attack where attackers target employees or executives to steal sensitive information or money. DMARC, by ensuring the authenticity of emails, helps reduce the success rate of BEC attempts by blocking fake emails from reaching their targets.

### 3. **Improving Email Deliverability**

DMARC doesn't just protect against malicious email—it can also help legitimate emails reach the inbox by ensuring email authentication. DMARC-compliant emails are less likely to be marked as spam by receiving servers, which boosts overall deliverability.

### 4. **Regulatory Compliance**

Many industries, governments, and cybersecurity insurance providers now require the use of DMARC for regulatory compliance. DMARC ensures that your email infrastructure aligns with evolving industry standards.
