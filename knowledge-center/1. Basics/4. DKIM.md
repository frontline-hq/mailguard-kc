# DKIM

**DKIM** (DomainKeys Identified Mail) is an email authentication method that allows the receiver to check if an email was sent and authorized by the owner of the domain. It works by affixing a digital signature to the email header.

When the email is received, the recipient server verifies the DKIM signature using the sender's public key, published in DNS. DKIM ensures that the email content hasn't been tampered with during transit.
