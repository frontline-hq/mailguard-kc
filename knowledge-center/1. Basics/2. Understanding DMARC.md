# Understanding DMARC

**DMARC** (Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting & Conformance) is a technical specification designed to authenticate email by ensuring alignment between **SPF** (Sender Policy Framework) and **DKIM** (DomainKeys Identified Mail) mechanisms. It provides a way to define how receiving servers should handle unauthenticated emails, ensuring better protection against phishing, spoofing, and email impersonation.

<Admonition type="info" title="What is DMARC?">
DMARC allows domain owners to:
- Authenticate email senders through SPF and DKIM alignment.
- Provide visibility on unauthorized use of their domain through reporting.
- Establish policies to quarantine or reject fraudulent emails that fail SPF/DKIM checks.
</Admonition>

DMARC acts as the **policy layer** built on top of SPF and DKIM, providing the enforcement necessary to handle unauthorized emails.

## Key Components of DMARC

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="spf" label="SPF">
    **SPF (Sender Policy Framework)** is an email authentication mechanism. It lets domain owners specify which mail servers are allowed to send emails on behalf of their domain by publishing an SPF record in DNS. When an email is received, the receiving mail server checks the SPF record against the sender’s IP address. If the sender is not authorized, the email fails the SPF check.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="dkim" label="DKIM">
    **DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)** is an authentication method that uses a digital signature to verify that the email has not been altered in transit. The signature is applied to the header and can be validated using the public key stored in DNS. DKIM ensures the integrity of the email and the legitimacy of its source.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="alignment" label="Alignment">
    **Alignment**: DMARC requires that the domain in the `From:` header of the email matches the domain used in SPF and DKIM checks. This ensures that both visible information (the sender's email address) and the underlying authentication mechanisms refer to the same legitimate domain. Without alignment, an email could pass SPF or DKIM checks but still be a spoofed email.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## The Role of DMARC in Email Authentication

DMARC is crucial because it not only builds on the underlying technologies of SPF and DKIM, but also **enforces policy alignment**. Even if an email passes SPF and DKIM, it could still be spoofed if the domains are not aligned. DMARC’s alignment check ensures that **both authentication methods** (SPF and DKIM) are applied in a unified and consistent manner.

## How DMARC Works

DMARC works by publishing a DNS record that outlines a domain's email authentication policy. This record includes instructions on how to handle unauthenticated emails and where to send reports on these failures.

1. **Policy Definition**: Domain owners create a DMARC policy as a DNS record that defines how unauthenticated emails should be handled (e.g., deliver, quarantine, reject).
2. **SPF/DKIM Authentication**: When an email is received, the mail server first checks the SPF and DKIM records to verify the email sender’s authenticity.
3. **Alignment Check**: DMARC ensures that the domain in the `From:` header aligns with the domains used in SPF and DKIM checks. This ensures consistency across visible and technical email components.
4. **Policy Enforcement**: Depending on the DMARC policy (`none`, `quarantine`, or `reject`), the receiving server takes the appropriate action on unauthenticated emails.
5. **Reporting**: DMARC provides reports (Aggregate and Forensic) that give domain owners insight into how their email domain is being used, including any failed authentication attempts. These reports help monitor unauthorized activity and optimize the DMARC policy over time.

<Admonition type="tip" title="RUA Reports">
DMARC reports are sent to the address specified in the `rua` (aggregate report) and `ruf` (forensic report) fields of the DMARC record. These reports provide crucial data on how emails from your domain are being handled by receiving servers.
</Admonition>

### DMARC Record: A Policy in the DNS

The DMARC policy is defined in a **TXT record** within your domain’s DNS. It provides the policy for handling unauthenticated emails and enables reporting functions. This record is crucial for enforcing email security across the domain.

### Key DMARC Tags:

- **v**: Version (currently `v=DMARC1`).
- **p**: Policy (`none`, `quarantine`, `reject`), which defines how to handle unauthenticated emails.
- **rua**: Address for aggregate reports, providing insights into email flows.

```plaintext
v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:receiver@mydomain.com;
```

## DMARC Policies

DMARC policies determine how the receiving server should handle emails that fail authentication checks. Here’s a breakdown of the three main policies:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="none" label="p=none">
    **p=none**: This policy monitors your email traffic without taking any action. Unauthorized emails are still delivered, but reports are generated so you can review potential threats.

    <Admonition type="info">
      This is a good starting point when you first implement DMARC to gather information and understand how your domain is being used.
    </Admonition>

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="quarantine" label="p=quarantine">
    **p=quarantine**: This policy sends unauthorized or suspicious emails to the recipient’s spam folder. This helps mitigate the risk while still allowing you to monitor potential email abuse.

    <Admonition type="caution">
      Use this policy once you have a good understanding of your email traffic and are ready to take stronger action against suspicious emails.
    </Admonition>

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="reject" label="p=reject">
    **p=reject**: This is the strictest policy and the final step in DMARC implementation. It ensures that unauthorized emails are completely blocked and never delivered to the recipient.

    <Admonition type="success">
      This is the ultimate goal of DMARC implementation. Once you’re confident in your email authentication setup, move to this policy to prevent all unauthorized emails.
    </Admonition>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## DMARC record tags

A DMARC record contains several tags that define how email receivers should handle emails that pass or fail DMARC checks. Below are all the possible DMARC tags, their meanings, and usage.

| **Tag** | **Description**                                           | **Values**                     | **Example**                             | **Notes**                                                                                       |

| `ruf`   | Forensic report email address or URI                      | Valid email or URI             | `ruf=mailto:dmarc-failures@example.com` | Not supported by all providers due to privacy and high-volume concerns.                         |
| `pct`   | Percentage of emails that the policy should be applied to | `1-100`                        | `pct=50`                                | Allows gradual implementation by only applying the policy to a percentage of emails.            |
| `aspf`  | Specifies SPF alignment mode                              | `s` (strict), `r` (relaxed)    | `aspf=s`                                | Strict mode requires exact domain matches; relaxed allows subdomains.                           |
| `adkim` | Specifies DKIM alignment mode                             | `s` (strict), `r` (relaxed)    | `adkim=r`                               | Similar to `aspf`, but for DKIM.                                                                |

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details >
  <summary>**What happens if I don't set the `sp` tag?**</summary>
    <p>

If the `sp` (Subdomain Policy) tag is not specified, subdomains will follow the policy set in the `p` tag. If your main domain is set to `p=reject`, subdomains will also reject unauthorized emails unless `sp` is specifically set.

  </p>

</details>

<details >
  <summary>**Should I use `ruf` for forensic reporting?**</summary>
    <p>

While forensic reports (`ruf`) provide detailed data on individual failed messages, they can create a large volume of traffic and are not supported by all email providers due to privacy and bandwidth concerns. Most users rely on aggregate reports (`rua`), which provide more manageable insights into email flow and authentication.

  </p>

</details>

<details >
  <summary>**What is the difference between `aspf=s` and `aspf=r`?**</summary>
    <p>

The `aspf` tag controls the alignment for SPF.

  </p>

</details>

<details >
  <summary>**Strict alignment (`aspf=s`)**</summary>
    <p>

requires that the domain in the `From:` header exactly matches the domain in the SPF check.

  </p>

</details>

<details >
  <summary>**Relaxed alignment (`aspf=r`)**</summary>
    <p>

allows subdomains to pass the SPF check as long as they share the same root domain.

  </p>

</details>

<details >
  <summary>**How often are reports sent if I don't specify the `ri` tag?**</summary>
    <p>

If the `ri` tag is not specified, DMARC aggregate reports are sent once every 24 hours by default. You can change this interval by specifying the `ri` tag with a different value in seconds.

  </p>
