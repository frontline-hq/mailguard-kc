# Shadow IT

**Shadow IT** refers to the use of unapproved applications, devices, or services within an organization’s IT infrastructure. These tools, used without the knowledge or approval of the IT department, can pose significant security risks, especially when it comes to email security.

## Why is Shadow IT a Risk?

Shadow IT bypasses an organization’s established security protocols, leaving the door open to vulnerabilities. Employees may unknowingly use unauthorized apps to send emails, share files, or manage projects, exposing sensitive company data to outside threats.

The risks associated with Shadow IT include:

- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Unauthorized email-sending services can introduce phishing, spoofing, and malware risks.
- **Data Leakage**: Unapproved apps may lack proper encryption, leading to unintended data exposure.
- **Compliance Issues**: Many industries have strict data regulations (such as GDPR). Using unapproved services may result in non-compliance with these regulations.

Shadow IT can be exploited by attackers through phishing emails or other malicious activities, potentially leading to compromised systems or data breaches.

## Real-World Example of Shadow IT

Imagine a marketing department using an unapproved email automation tool to send newsletters to thousands of customers. This service bypasses the IT department's authorized email systems, meaning it might not adhere to the company’s **DMARC policy** or other security measures. The use of such unauthorized tools poses several risks:

1. **Phishing Exposure**: Since the marketing tool doesn't follow the company's DMARC policy, it could easily allow emails to be sent that look legitimate but are vulnerable to spoofing. Phishing attackers might exploit this loophole to send harmful emails that appear to be from the company's domain, deceiving customers.

2. **Deliverability Issues**: The marketing tool might not align with the company's SPF and DKIM settings. As a result, when the emails are checked against the DMARC policy by recipient mail servers, they could fail authentication, leading to the emails being marked as spam or rejected outright. This decreases email deliverability, potentially impacting important communication with customers.

If the marketing tool sends emails that fail DMARC checks, these emails are likely to be rejected by recipients. This can result in several issues:
- **Communication Breakdown**: Emails not reaching customers can disrupt marketing campaigns, product updates, or critical company announcements.
- **Damage to Reputation**: Customers receiving or missing fake emails may lose trust in your brand, thinking that the company’s emails are unsafe or unreliable.
- **Wasted Costs**: With many email automation services, you pay per email sent. Failing DMARC checks means you’re paying for emails that are never delivered, wasting resources and potentially hurting your bottom line.

Let’s consider a scenario where your marketing team uses an email automation tool not reviewed by your IT department. This tool sends newsletters from `news@yourdomain.com`. However, the tool's email server isn’t properly configured for **SPF** or **DKIM**, so the emails it sends don’t pass **DMARC checks**.

Here’s what happens next:

- A customer’s email server checks the email and notices that it doesn’t align with the SPF/DKIM records for `yourdomain.com`.
- Because of the strict **p=reject** policy in your DMARC record, the recipient’s server rejects the email, preventing it from reaching the inbox.
- The marketing team is unaware that the emails are being rejected and continues paying for undelivered messages.

If the marketing tool had been approved and configured by the IT department, it would have adhered to SPF and DKIM policies, ensuring DMARC compliance. This would have prevented email rejection, reduced security risks, and maintained the brand’s reputation and deliverability.

## How DMARC Helps Manage Shadow IT

By implementing DMARC, you can monitor and control email traffic, gaining visibility into any unapproved email services that might be using your domain. DMARC reports give domain owners insight into all email sources, helping to identify legitimate versus unauthorized usage.

If your DMARC reports indicate that emails are being sent from unknown or unauthorized services, this may signal the presence of Shadow IT. By identifying these sources, you can take corrective action to shut down or secure those services.

## Preventing Shadow IT

To minimize the risks of Shadow IT, organizations should:

- **Enforce DMARC Policies**: Ensure unauthorized emails are blocked, quarantined, or flagged.
- **Educate Employees**: Train employees on the dangers of using unauthorized apps and the importance of adhering to IT policies.
- **Monitor DMARC Reports**: Regularly review DMARC aggregate reports to identify potential instances of Shadow IT.

By closely monitoring email traffic and enforcing strict DMARC policies, you can protect your domain from unauthorized services and secure your organization against email-based threats.
