# Setting Up DMARC

Setting up DMARC ensures your domain’s emails are properly authenticated and offers protection against email spoofing and phishing attacks. With DMARC in place, you can enforce policies on unauthenticated emails and receive reports on the use of your domain across email traffic.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Why Set Up DMARC?">
Setting up DMARC provides the tools necessary to authenticate your emails and mitigate email-based attacks. Implementing DMARC ensures that only authorized senders can use your domain, preventing phishing and other email-based threats.

## DMARC Record: Defining the Policy in DNS

A DMARC record is published as a **TXT record** in the DNS of your domain. This record sets policies for how email receivers handle emails that fail DMARC checks and defines where reports should be sent. Here’s an example DMARC record:

```plaintext
v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:receiver@mydomain.com;
```

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="none" label="p=none">
    <Admonition type="info">
      Use `p=none` to review DMARC reports and analyze your email authentication system before applying stricter policies. Monitoring is especially critical for larger domains, as it helps uncover **Shadow IT**—unapproved applications and services sending emails from your domain.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="quarantine" label="p=quarantine">
    **p=quarantine**: With the `quarantine` policy, emails that fail DMARC checks are sent to the spam or junk folder. This prevents unauthorized emails from reaching the inbox while still allowing users to access the messages.
    <Admonition type="caution">
      Transition to `p=quarantine` after gathering sufficient data from reports. This policy is a middle ground, offering protection while still monitoring email flow.
```plaintext
v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:receiver@mydomain.com;
````
    </Admonition>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="reject" label="p=reject">
    **p=reject**: The `reject` policy is the most **strict** policy. Unauthorized emails are **completely blocked** and are not delivered to the recipient. This ensures full protection against email spoofing.
    <Admonition type="success">
      Once you’ve validated all legitimate email senders, move to `p=reject` to fully protect your domain from unauthorized emails.
      ```plaintext
v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:receiver@mydomain.com;
```

## DMARC Record: Defining the Policy in DNS

To implement DMARC, you need to create a TXT record in your domain’s DNS settings. This record contains your DMARC policy, which tells email receivers how to handle emails that fail DMARC checks (SPF/DKIM). It also specifies where to send reports (aggregate or forensic) regarding the use of your domain in email traffic.

### DMARC Record Structure

When creating a DMARC record, there are two key components you need to define in your DNS settings:

**Name:** The DMARC record must be set up under a specific subdomain called \_dmarc. For example, if your domain is mydomain.com, the full name of your DMARC record would be \_dmarc.mydomain.com.<br/>
**Value:** The value of the TXT record defines the actual DMARC policy. This includes various tags such as v, p, rua, and others.

Here's an example of a basic DMARC record set up:

Name: `_dmarc.mydomain.com` <br/>
Value: `v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:receiver@mydomain.com;`<br/>
Type: `TXT`

This policy `p=reject` blocks all emails that fail DMARC authentication and ensures they are not delivered to the recipient.

## Setting up DMARC for Small Businesses or Personal Domains

<Admonition type="caution" title="Caution">
When setting up DMARC for a larger organization, it can significantly impact email delivery if not done correctly. We recommend using **Mailguard** and following our DMARC rollout process to secure your domain without disrupting email deliverability.
</Admonition>

Setting up DMARC for small companies or personal domains is very straightforward and usually doesn’t result in any major disruption to email deliverability. This is because, in most cases, small businesses or personal domains use a single cloud-based email service provider (like Gmail, Office 365, or other hosted services), which simplifies the DMARC configuration.

Here’s why it’s easy to set up DMARC for smaller setups:

1. Single Source of Email: Most small businesses or personal domains only send emails through a single provider, which means the SPF and DKIM configurations are already set up by default by your email provider. As long as you’re using a recognized service, DMARC is unlikely to impact email deliverability.

2. Minimal Complexity: Unlike larger organizations that may use multiple email-sending services (marketing tools, CRM systems, internal email servers), smaller setups don’t need to worry about managing different sources, making DMARC easier to implement and test.

3. Step-by-Step Setup: You can follow a simple rollout process:

Start with p=none to monitor email traffic and ensure your email provider is passing DMARC checks.
Once you’ve confirmed all legitimate emails are properly authenticated, move to p=quarantine or p=reject for stronger enforcement.
Here’s how you can create a DMARC record for your small domain:

Name: `_dmarc.mydomain.com`<br/>
Value: `v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:receiver@mydomain.com;`<br/>
Type: `TXT`

This setup allows you to monitor email traffic and collect reports without affecting email deliverability. Once you’ve gathered enough data and validated your setup, you can easily move to a more restrictive policy (p=quarantine or p=reject) for full protection.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Why It's Easy for Small Setups"> For small businesses and personal domains, setting up DMARC is simple because there’s typically just one trusted email provider sending on your behalf. This reduces the complexity of managing multiple email-sending sources, making it unlikely to affect email deliverability. Therefore, most of the time, switching to `p=reject` is a quicker and shorter process than it would be for larger businesses. </Admonition>
