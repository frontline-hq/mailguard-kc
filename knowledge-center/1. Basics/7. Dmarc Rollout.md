# DMARC Rollout: A Step-by-Step Guide

Rolling out **DMARC** (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) is essential for protecting your domain from email-based threats. Here's a step-by-step approach to ensure a successful DMARC deployment, focusing on gathering data, improving deliverability, and enforcing strict policies.

### Step 1: Assess Your Current Email Infrastructure

Before starting your DMARC rollout, you need to analyze your existing email infrastructure:

- **Identify All Email-Sending Domains**: Take inventory of all domains and subdomains that send emails on your behalf.
- **Review Your SPF and DKIM Setup**: Ensure that all sending domains are authenticated via SPF and DKIM, as DMARC builds on these protocols.

:::info
DMARC relies on SPF and DKIM being correctly configured. Make sure to review these settings before implementing DMARC.

### Step 2: Implement DMARC in ‘p=none’ Mode

Starting with the `p=none` policy allows you to monitor your domain’s email traffic without affecting email delivery:

`v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto
@yourdomain.com;`

- **What It Does**: Monitors your domain’s email activity and sends DMARC aggregate reports to the specified `rua` email address without blocking any emails.
- **Monitor Reports**: Use these reports to identify legitimate and unauthorized email sources.

:::tip
Start with `p=none` to gather valuable data on how your domain is being used. This will help you identify misconfigurations and unauthorized email activity.
:::

### Step 3: Analyze and Review DMARC Reports

DMARC aggregate reports provide insight into your domain’s email usage:

- **Identify Legitimate Email Sources**: Ensure all legitimate email-sending services are passing DMARC checks.
- **Spot Unauthorized Senders**: Investigate suspicious email-sending sources, which may indicate spoofing or misconfigured systems.

:::caution
Unauthorized email-sending tools like marketing automation systems not approved by IT can lead to DMARC failures. Be sure to monitor reports closely.
:::

### Step 4: Move to ‘p=quarantine’ Mode

Once you're confident about your legitimate email sources, update your policy to `p=quarantine` to improve email security:

`v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto
@yourdomain.com;`

- **Effect**: Emails that fail DMARC checks will be sent to the recipient’s spam folder, reducing the chance of unauthorized emails being seen.
- **Action**: Continue to monitor reports and adjust your SPF/DKIM records if any legitimate emails are being quarantined.

### Step 5: Move to ‘p=reject’ Mode

Once you have confidence in your email authentication setup, move to the **strictest policy**—`p=reject`:

`v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto
@yourdomain.com;`

- **Effect**: Emails that fail DMARC checks will be completely rejected, protecting your domain from spoofing and phishing attacks.
- **Final Protection**: This policy ensures that only authenticated and aligned emails are delivered.

By moving to `p=reject`, you fully protect your domain from unauthorized email use and greatly reduce the risk of phishing attacks.

# DMARC Rollout Timeline

A phased rollout helps ensure that implementing DMARC doesn't interfere with your legitimate email flow while progressively increasing your domain's security.

### **Weeks 1-4: Implement `p=none`**

During the first stage of rollout, you’ll set your DMARC policy to `p=none`. This is a **monitoring mode** that allows you to gather data without affecting how emails are handled.

- **Objective**: Identify all email sources sending on behalf of your domain, both legitimate and unauthorized.
- **What to Monitor**: Using the DMARC aggregate reports (`rua`), review the reports to see if any emails are failing DMARC authentication, including SPF or DKIM checks. This period allows you to build an understanding of where misconfigurations or shadow IT (unauthorized email systems) might exist.

**Key Actions**:

- Review all legitimate email-sending services and ensure they pass SPF/DKIM checks.
- Detect and address unauthorized emails or misconfigurations.

:::info
This stage is critical for **gathering data** and gives you insights into whether any legitimate email services need reconfiguration.
:::

### **Weeks 5-8: Transition to `p=quarantine`**

Once you have reviewed the reports and feel confident about your legitimate email-sending sources, you can transition to `p=quarantine`. This mode is more **restrictive** but still allows emails that fail DMARC checks to reach recipients, albeit in their **spam or junk folders**.

- **Objective**: Filter out emails that fail authentication, without completely rejecting them.
- **What to Monitor**: Continue to monitor the DMARC reports to ensure no legitimate emails are being quarantined. If you discover any legitimate emails in the spam folder, correct SPF/DKIM misconfigurations or ensure they are included in your authorized sender lists.

**Key Actions**:

- Ensure that all authorized email-sending services pass SPF/DKIM and align with your DMARC policy.
- Identify emails being quarantined that shouldn’t be and adjust the setup.

:::caution
This stage helps **reduce risk** by filtering suspicious emails but still allows for monitoring and adjustments before applying stricter enforcement.
:::

### **Weeks 9-12: Implement `p=reject`**

After validating all legitimate email sources, move to `p=reject`, the strictest policy. This ensures that any emails failing DMARC authentication will be **completely rejected** and never delivered to the recipient.

- **Objective**: Provide full protection from spoofing by rejecting unauthorized emails entirely.
- **What to Monitor**: Continue to check the DMARC reports to verify that all legitimate emails are being delivered and that only unauthorized emails are rejected. Ensure that email flows remain smooth after applying the `reject` policy.

**Key Actions**:

- Implement the `p=reject` policy to block unauthorized emails.
- Continue to monitor the email flow and reports to ensure full protection.

:::success
The `p=reject` policy offers the **highest level of protection** against email spoofing, ensuring that unauthorized or malicious emails are rejected outright.
:::

## Why Use a Phased Approach?

By progressively rolling out DMARC, starting with monitoring and gradually moving toward full enforcement, you reduce the risk of disrupting legitimate email flows. Each stage builds confidence that all legitimate sources are properly authenticated, minimizing the risk of blocking legitimate emails. This phased approach helps ensure that **email authentication** is working as intended while improving overall **email security**.
